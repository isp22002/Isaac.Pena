Project Highlights: Physics in Action

As part of my undergraduate journey, I’ve had the opportunity to engage in research and projects that bridge experimental physics, data analysis, and computational modeling. Below are some highlights:

1. Experimental Physics Research with Professor Colombo

Under the guidance of Professor Colombo, I have been investigating the stability and behavior of 3D-printed optical mounts. This project explores how different materials, design geometries, and environmental factors affect long-term performance and vibration resistance.

Through this research, I’ve gained experience in precision measurement, data collection, and statistical uncertainty analysis by applying both theoretical understanding and experimental techniques to assess mechanical stability. The project also connects to sustainable laboratory practices by leveraging additive manufacturing as a low-cost alternative to traditional optical components.

2. Computational Modeling and Simulation

As part of my coursework and independent study, I’ve developed Python-based models for analyzing physical systems, including harmonic motion and particle dynamics in potential fields. These simulations help visualize how classical and quantum systems evolve and have deepened my understanding of numerical methods in modern physics.

3. Society of Physics Students (SPS) Outreach and Engagement

Beyond research, I’ve taken an active role in SPS, helping organize outreach events that introduce fundamental physics through interactive demonstrations. This experience has strengthened my skills in science communication and teamwork, as well as my appreciation for physics as a collaborative and accessible field.

These experiences have not only expanded my technical skill set — from data-driven analysis to experimental design — but also shaped how I approach problem-solving as a physicist.

✨ Stay tuned for future updates and research highlights!
