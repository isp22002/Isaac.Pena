title: Welcome to my professional portfolio!
--- 

I am a Physics major at the University of Connecticut, graduating in Spring 2025. With a strong foundation in theoretical and applied physics, my academic journey has focused on data analysis, computational modeling, and experimental research. I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and the pursuit of understanding ‚Äî skills I hope to apply in graduate research or R&D roles after graduation.

About Me

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have engaged in projects and research experiences that highlight the power of physics in solving real-world problems. From analyzing experimental data to developing computational simulations, I enjoy bridging theory with application. I‚Äôm also active in the Society of Physics Students (SPS), where I help lead outreach and student engagement events.

My core skills include:

Computational & Data Tools: Python, MATLAB, Excel, Origin

Physics Applications: Classical Mechanics, Quantum Physics, Statistical Physics, and Electromagnetism

Communication & Leadership: Public outreach through SPS, mentoring peers in advanced coursework

Projects

1. SPS Outreach Program
Helped organize and present physics demonstrations to undergraduate students and the general public, aiming to make core physical concepts engaging and accessible.

2. Computational Modeling Project (Coursework)
Developed a numerical solver in Python to analyze wave motion and energy transfer in complex systems.
