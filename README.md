 Welcome to my professional portfolio!

I am a Physics major at the University of Connecticut, graduating in Spring 2025. With a strong foundation in theoretical and applied physics, my academic journey has focused on data analysis, computational modeling, and experimental research. I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and the pursuit of understanding skills I hope to apply in graduate research or R&D roles after graduation.

About Me

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have engaged in projects and research experiences that highlight the power of physics in solving real-world problems. From analyzing experimental data to developing computational simulations, I enjoy bridging theory with application. I‚Äôm also active in the Society of Physics Students (SPS), where I help lead outreach and student engagement events.

## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Nice work, friend :heart:! People will be reading your blog in no time!_

You can now [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) your pull request!

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your changes

1. Merge your changes from `my-pages` into `main`. If you created the pull request in step 2, just open that PR and click on **Merge pull request**. If you did not create the pull request earlier, you can do it now by following the instructions in [step 2](/.github/steps/2-configure-your-site.md).
1. (optional) Delete the branch `my-pages`.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

_Welcome to GitHub Pages and Jekyll :tada:!_

The first step is to enable GitHub Pages on this [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository). When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that's on the main branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
1. Click **Pages** in the **Code and automation** section.
1. Ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected from the **Source** drop-down menu, and then select `main` from the **Branch** drop-down menu.
1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Wait about _one minute_ then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
   > Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. GitHub Actions may take up to a minute to respond while waiting for the deployment. Future steps will be about 20 seconds; this step is slower.
   > **Note**: In the **Pages** of **Settings**, the **Visit site** button will appear at the top. Click the button to see your GitHub Pages site.

  Historic note: previous version checked for empty pull request, changed to the correct theme `minima`.

## Step 2: Configure your site

_You turned on GitHub Pages! :tada:_

We'll work in a branch, `my-pages`, that I created for you to get this site looking great. :sparkle:

Jekyll uses a file titled `_config.yml` to store settings for your site, your theme, and reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle. You can check out the `_config.yml` file on the **Code** tab of your repository.

We need to use a blog-ready theme. For this activity, we will use a theme named "minima".

### :keyboard: Activity: Configure your site

1. Browse to the `_config.yml` file in the `my-pages` branch.
1. In the upper right corner, open the file editor.
1. Add a `theme:` set to **minima** so it shows in the `_config.yml` file as below:
   ```yml
   theme: minima
   ```
1. (optional) You can modify the other configuration variables such as `title:`, `author:`, and `description:` to further customize your site.
1. Commit your changes.
1. (optional) Create a pull request to view all the changes you'll make throughout this course. Click the **Pull Requests** tab, click **New pull request**, set `base: main` and `compare:my-pages`.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
