I am a Physics major at the University of Connecticut, graduating in Spring 2025. With a strong foundation in theoretical and applied physics, my academic journey has focused on data analysis, computational modeling, and experimental research. I’m driven by curiosity and the pursuit of understanding — skills I hope to apply in graduate research or R&D roles after graduation.

About Me

Throughout my undergraduate career, I have engaged in projects and research experiences that highlight the power of physics in solving real-world problems. From analyzing experimental data to developing computational simulations, I enjoy bridging theory with application. I’m also active in the Society of Physics Students (SPS), where I help lead outreach and student engagement events.

My core skills include:

Computational & Data Tools: Python, MATLAB, Excel, Origin

Physics Applications: Classical Mechanics, Quantum Physics, Statistical Physics, and Electromagnetism

Communication & Leadership: Public outreach through SPS, mentoring peers in advanced coursework
